    <h1>My Last Letter to You</h1>
    <p class="typing">
hii, it’s me… I know we are strangers now, but to me, it feels like yesterday we were still together.
Those days still linger in my mind, even when I try to forget and keep myself busy.
But no matter what I do, the empty space you left behind keeps tormenting me.

You left me when I truly loved you. Sometimes I wonder… was the love I gave not enough for you,
or maybe I gave too much? I just want you to know that I never meant to hurt you,
I never wanted our fights to happen. That night — I still don’t even know if you were truly serious
about what you said to me. But still, I’m not angry at you. I don’t blame you.
I only feel bad for myself — because I thought I had finally found a home to return to,
a place where I could rest and express everything… but it turned out to be only a temporary stopover,
leaving me with the deepest wound I’ve ever felt.

Sometimes I wonder if God doesn’t like me, for taking away every person I love.
And now, when I see your smile again, you look so happy there.
I feel ashamed, because I’m still enduring the pain here alone.

From the beginning, I knew he liked you… and maybe… you like him too.
If that’s true, then promise me one thing: love him more than you ever loved me.
Take care of that relationship with him. Don’t let it break no matter what…
not like what happened with us.

So, for the last time, I hope for you to keep smiling,
keep being happy no matter who you’re with and no matter what life throws at you.
Don’t let the pain I’ve endured go to waste.
You don’t have to think about me anymore.
Let me carry the weight of missing you alone.
I don’t want my love to hurt you anymore.
If my love was a burden, I’ll let go of it as grace and forgiveness.

If you can hear my apology, I’m willing to say it a million times with all my heart:
I’m sorry. Please be happy there, my beloved.
And if one day you ever need anything from me, I’ll be here — waiting quietly, without any expectations.
